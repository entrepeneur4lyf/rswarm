### High Priority (Critical Improvements)
- [X] 1. Implement proper error handling
  - Create custom error types with `thiserror`
  - Replace unwrap() calls with proper error handling
  - Add input validation for critical paths

- [ ] 2. Add essential safety features
  - [ ] Request timeouts
  - [ ] API URL validation
  - [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] Input sanitization

- [ ] 3. Improve test coverage
  - [ ] Add mocks for OpenAI API
  - [ ] Unit tests for core components
  - [ ] Error case testing

### Medium Priority (Important Enhancements)
- [ ] 4. Configuration improvements
  - [ ] Implement SwarmBuilder pattern
  - [ ] Make hardcoded values configurable
  - [ ] Add configuration validation

- [ ] 5. Documentation
  - [ ] Add rustdoc comments for public APIs
  - [ ] Include usage examples
  - [ ] Document error cases and handling

- [ ] 6. Performance optimizations
  - [ ] Review and optimize clone() usage
  - [ ] Implement connection pooling
  - [ ] Memory usage optimization for message history

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)
- [ ] 7. Code organization
  - [ ] Split large modules into smaller ones
  - [ ] Add type aliases for complex types
  - [ ] Implement more builder patterns

- [ ] 8. Additional features
  - [ ] Retry mechanism
  - [ ] Better logging
  - [ ] Metrics/telemetry

- [ ] 9. Advanced testing
  - [ ] Property-based testing
  - [ ] Integration test suite
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Suggested First Steps
1. Start with error handling as it's fundamental to safety
2. Add timeouts and basic validation
3. Implement basic test mocks
